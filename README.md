Roxanna Coldiron - Solo Project Proposal
========================================

Summary Paragraph:
------------------

My project will be recreating a WordPress site for a mechanical parts company as a Django site. 
The WordPress site is very bloated and slowed down with tons of plugins, so I want to make a similar site that is cleaner and faster because of using Django. It will feature an admin backend for uploading Product information (image, description) with a Request A Quote button that goes to a Django Form, pre-populated with the chosen product. 

Features List:
--------------

**P0** - Django Admin, images, Django Forms, Django built-in User and Authentication

Models
- Blogs or Posts
- Products (title, images, description, category, quantity, in stock/out of stock)

**P1** - Templates, django-sass, Bootstrap CSS
